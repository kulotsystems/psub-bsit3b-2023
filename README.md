### Preview
Open `index.html` on your web browser.

### Contributing
Create your personal `.js` named `yourfirstname.js` file inside the [**js**](js) folder.
        <br>
        Then, fill it up with your basic personal information as shown below:
        
```javascript
devs.push({

    firstName : 'YourFirstName',
    middleName: 'YourMiddleName',
    lastName  : 'YourLastName',
    gender    : '[Male/Female]',
    username  : 'YourGitHubUsername'

});
```

You can also look at [arvic.js](js/arvic.js) for further reference.

After creating your own file, link it to the `index.html` by adding a new script tag.

```html
<!-- START WORK HERE (Add personal scripts) -->
<script src="js/arvic.js"></script>
...
```

If you see your name on the list of members, you're good to go.
